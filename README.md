# Very Good trip : a spotify playlist maker
---
## Prerequisites
In order to run the script, you will need a Spotify account and you will need to [register a Spotify app](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) a nice guide for which can be found [here](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.9.0/#getting-started). You will also need to register with the [Genius API](https://docs.genius.com/#/getting-started-h1) in order to get a client access token.

Inspired by a lot of project, but mostly this [one](https://github.com/eric-hochberger/sample-playlists)

Going from a page of a radio show to a playlist in spotify.

## work in progress 
Will be adding - if the god of time lend me some free time - :
 - webscrapping page when there is one artist
 - webscrapping older page
 - automatically choosing between different scrapping method (old/new/artist..)
 - Adding information to a general table for 'data science'
 - Automatically scrapping all pages to archive
 - process exceptions
 - a LOT whole more.
